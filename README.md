## Introduction

The **Planetarium Project** was developed by the Faffi Group with the aim of creating an immersive, 3D digital planetarium experience. This project allows users to simulate piloting an AstroJet (Astronomy Jet) around the solar system. It provides the opportunity to travel up close to each planet and learn detailed information about them.

This project is designed for anyone with an interest in astronomy, from students to enthusiasts, and offers an engaging, interactive way to explore space. With a combination of stunning visuals, realistic navigation, and educational content, the Planetarium brings space exploration to life.

---

## Why Planetarium?

We wanted to create an application that gives users a realistic space experience while also enhancing their understanding of astronomy. By allowing users to simulate piloting an AstroJet and explore the planets in detail, we aim to make learning about the solar system fun and engaging.

### Key Benefits

1. **Interactive Content**: Explore planets up close, and learn through engaging, interactive experiences.
2. **Accessible to Everyone**: Designed for students and astronomy enthusiasts alike, providing an easy-to-use interface.
3. **Space Vehicle Simulation**: Experience realistic space navigation by piloting an AstroJet. _**(Optional)**_

---

## Tools Used

- **Unity 2022.3.22f1**: Game engine used for building and rendering the 3D world.
- **Blender**: Used for 3D modeling (*only for backup in case of need for manual shading/model adjustments*).
- **Photoshop**: Used for 2D design and textures (*only for backup in case of need for manual shading/model adjustments*).
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tool for code management.

---

## Features

1. **Shaders**: We implemented various shaders, including the planet's color and metallic shader for the AstroJet.
2. **Geometry**: The 3D models include planetary shapes, surfaces, and the AstroJet.
3. **Lighting**: The sun serves as the primary source of lighting.
4. **Animations**: Features include planetary rotation and revolution.
5. **User Interface**: Users can inspect planets to display key details such as temperature, size, and other informative data.

---

## Future Plans

We aim to further refine the simulation, adding more detailed planetary textures, advanced AstroJet controls, and expanding the range of informative content to cover more celestial bodies.

Here's a detailed **Control Tutorial** section to integrate into your **Planetarium Project** simulation game. This tutorial will ensure users understand how to pilot the AstroJet smoothly and navigate the solar system effectively.

---

## üïπÔ∏è **Basic Controls**

### üîπ **Throttle and Movement**

- **Throttle Up (Accelerate)**:  
  Press **`Space`** to increase your speed and move forward.

- **Throttle Down (Decelerate)**:  
  Release **`Space`** to slow down or stop.

### üîπ **Directional Controls**

- **Yaw (Turn Left/Right)**:  
  - Press **`Q`** to turn the AstroJet **left**.  
  - Press **`E`** to turn the AstroJet **right**.

- **Pitch (Move Up/Down)**:  
  - Press **`W`** to tilt the nose **up**.  
  - Press **`S`** to tilt the nose **down**.

- **Roll (Bank Left/Right)**:  
  - Press **`A`** to bank the AstroJet **left**.  
  - Press **`D`** to bank the AstroJet **right**.

### üîπ **Pausing the Simulation**

- **Pause Menu**:  
  Press **`Escape`** to pause the game and access the menu.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tips for Smooth Navigation**

1. **Combining Controls**: For realistic movement, combine yaw and pitch adjustments to perform smooth turns.
2. **Stabilizing Your Flight**: Use roll controls (`A` and `D`) to balance your AstroJet after sharp turns.
3. **Exploring Planets**: Throttle up using `Space` to approach planets, and throttle down to observe details up close.

---

## üåå **Ready to Explore?**

Now that you're familiar with the controls, you're ready to navigate the solar system! Pilot your AstroJet, visit planets, and learn fascinating details about each celestial body.

Happy exploring, AstroJet Pilot! üöÄ‚ú®
